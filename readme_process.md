Backstory on this… I haven’t sold really any of these but have gotten good feedback on the few trials I did with it and want to try to use this new site to sell it which is actually on etsy so it could fit good anywhere like a button in the menu but then have its own section on the homepage or something - https://www.etsy.com/listing/1749230868/roots-to-fruits-storytelling-kit

I currently have this up on the site but Im not looking to do a woocommerce anymore and will just try to sell through Etsy for now - https://honestus.world/product/roots-to-fruits-storytelling-kit/
